# Main Project struction

1. Tutorial consist of c++, Java and Python core features, algorithms and web application programming interfaces (APIs).

## Technology Stack

1) Java version 8+ (jdk1.8+)
2) Python version 3.7+
3) c++ version 14+

While older versions of the aformentioned technology stacks are compatible with the projects, there is no guarantee that all the files will run successfully. Hence, it is advisable to use the most recent versions stated in the list above.
