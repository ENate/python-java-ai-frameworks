# Main Features of Java 8:

This tutorial presents some of the features introduced in Java 8+. The discussion is focused on major changes added to the Java 8 library. In parts of the discussion, we mention some of the changes which were added in Java 5!
 In this part of the tutorial, we cover the following topics:

## Lambda expressions

## Method references

## Functional interfaces

## Streams API

Adds functional programming from Java 8. It can be defined by a stream pipeline and consists of a source, an intermediate operation (or zero) and a terminal operation. It also includes  includes the following advantages:

- Adds efficiency in programming
- Makes use of Lambda expressions
- Facilitates the use of multi-thread via Parallel streams.

Stream operations source mainly come from the collections, operation can be a map, sorting etc. The intermediate operations can be changed, while terminal operation consists of reduction outcomes. Large data sets canbe filtered in intermediate operations to increase performance. Parallel streams are suited from large operations. Only one terminal operation can be assigned to a given stream operation.

## Default methods

## Base64 Encode Decode

## Static methods in interface

## Optional class
